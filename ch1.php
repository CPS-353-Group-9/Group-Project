				<h4>What is Programming?</h4>
					
				<p> As defined by Wikipedia, "Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result." Basically, programming is telling a computer to do something--as simple as that!</p>
				
				<p>Different programming languages have been developed (and continue to be developed) to make it easier for people to do this. Python is arguably one of the simplest to learn but has a lot of great functionality and is quite versatile in its use. That is why we chose the language as the basis for our site--we want to make it easy for you to jump right in and be able to call yourself a programmer!</p>

				<h4>Variables and Data Types</h4>

				<p>In every coding language, there are what are called <span class="keywords">data types</span> and a way to store different types of data. The way to store data is with a <span class="keywords">variable</span>. </p>

				<h4>Print Statements</h4>

				<p>Now say we have some variables, what if we wanted to see them on our screen? This is where <span class="keywords">print statements</span> come in.</p>
